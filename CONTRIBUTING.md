# Contributing to Skeenode

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Code Style
*   **Go**: We follow standard `go fmt` style.
*   **Python**: We follow PEP 8.
*   **Commits**: Use conventional commits (e.g., `feat: add scheduler logic`, `fix: handle timeouts`).

## Pull Request Process
1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers.

## Development Setup
Refer to the `Makefile` in the root directory for standard commands.
